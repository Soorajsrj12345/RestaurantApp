React
.......

npx create-react-app appname

npm start


building blocks of react
.........................

html
css
js


<> </>   -> empty fragment used instead of div


Angular                                                     React
........                                                  ...........

- framework                                             - library of js
- real DOM                                              - virtual DOM  


Advantages of React
....................

1. react uses virtual DOM(faster)
2. reusable components 
3. jsx (javascript xml)


Components In React
....................

1. class based           ->statefull components
2. function based        -> stateless components

statefull components
stateless components

-react hooks

state
.........
object used to store data inside a component in react

usestate - react


props(properties)
................

to share datas from parent to child component


API call in js
..............

Ajax
....

-xmlHttp
-fetch
-async  await

first working hook of a component
.................................
useEffect  -  react


Redirection or Routing in React
................................

react-router-dom     -  library used for Routing

Browser Router  - wrap the main component inside browser router component
Route           - wrap  the component inside Router which need redirection 
Routes          - wrap all the router if we set morethan one component paths 

Link  - a component react-router-dom  used for redirection

useParams - hook in react-router-dom used to access params



REDUX
......

when coupling increases in components there is a chance for props drilling

coupling - data sharing from parents to child
props drilling - at the time of data sharing from parent to child if any intermidiate
     component have any errors then the data will stuck there

REDUX -  state management technology  -  we need to reduce coupling and make all component indipendent to avoid props drilling

store - a file used to store data in redux 
        .all components can access the datas inside store 


libraries for redux
....................

-redux
-react-redux
-redux-thunk
                 npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk


create store -  method in redux used to create a store 


In REDUX Middleware used to make REDUX as asynchronous(actually redux is synchronous 
so all synchronous functions inside redux will behave as synchronous).

thunk -  used to create Middleware


http Methods In React
......................

axios -  library used to call API  {npm i axios -> for insatllation}

useDispatch -  hook used to Dispatch a function in a component
useSelector -  hook used to access data from component
